I am currently a research intern at [Northwestern University]([https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/](https://www.northwestern.edu/)), under the supervision of [Prof. Kaize Ding]([https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Xrh1OIUAAAAJ](https://kaize0409.github.io/)). I obtained my B.E. degree from Xidian University in 2021 and M.E. degree from Tsinghua University in 2024. My research interests are generally in data mining and machine learning, with a focus on reliable, efficient and automated AI systems. Meanwhile, I am passionate about developing data-centric algorithms to advance applications in social media, urban science and environmental science.

### Current Research Interests

- **Data-Centric AI: Time Series, Spatiotemporal Graph, Click-through Rate**
- **Trustworthy ML: Fraud, Anomaly and OOD Data**
- **Generative AI and and Applications: Urban Science and Environment Science**

### Contact Information
