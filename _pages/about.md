I am currently a research intern at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/), under the supervision of [Prof. Kaize Ding](https://kaize0409.github.io/). I obtained my B.E. degree from Xidian University and M.E. degree from Tsinghua University. My research interests are generally in data mining and machine learning, with a focus on reliable, efficient and automated AI systems. Meanwhile, I am passionate about developing data-centric algorithms to advance applications in social media, urban science and environmental science.

### Current Research Interests

- **Data-Centric AI: Time Series, Spatiotemporal Graph**
- **Trustworthy ML: Fraud, Anomaly and OOD Data**
- **Generative AI and Applications: Urban Science and Environmental Science**

### Contact Information

I am enthusiastic about the prospect of collaboration. Please feel free to reach out to me via [email](mailto:kevin.kxzhang@gmail.com).<br>
